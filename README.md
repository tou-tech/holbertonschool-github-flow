# GitHub Collaboration Workshop Repository

This repository is used in a workshop focused on learning collaboration practices with Git and GitHub using a document-based workflow.

The goal is to simulate a small documentation project where multiple collaborators work on different documents, propose changes through branches and pull requests, review each other's work, and handle merge conflicts.

## Project structure

All editable content for this workshop lives in the `docs/` directory:

- `docs/introduction.md` — Introduction to the fictional project and its purpose.
- `docs/history.md` — History and important milestones of the project.
- `docs/collaboration.md` — Notes about how collaboration is expected to work in this project.
- `docs/workflow-overview.md` — High-level description of how changes are typically proposed and merged.

Participants in the workshop will:

- Create feature branches for specific document changes.
- Edit these documents in a controlled way.
- Open pull requests and review each other's work.
- Resolve merge conflicts when they appear.
- Tag and release specific versions of the documentation.
