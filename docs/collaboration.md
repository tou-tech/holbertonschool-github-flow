# Collaboration Guidelines

Collaboration requires clear communication and well-defined responsibilities. Contributors are encouraged to make small, focused changes and to explain their reasoning clearly in commit messages and pull requests.

When multiple people work on these documents, it is common for changes to overlap. Overlapping changes can lead to merge conflicts, which are a normal part of a collaborative workflow.

The most important aspect of collaboration is communication. Comments in pull requests, documentation updates, and clear descriptions of changes all help maintain a shared understanding of the project.
